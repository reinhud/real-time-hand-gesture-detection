## 1. Introduction and Overview
Welcome to the Real-Time Hand Gesture Detection project! This project is part of a university assignment aimed at implementing a real-time hand gesture detection system.


## 2. Key Features
- Detection of hand gestures from a video source
- Distinction between gestures and random movements
- Detection and classification should happen in real time


## 3. Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow the instructions below.
